# randomizer-csgo [![.github/workflows/build_and_pre-release.yml](https://github.com/Luziferium/randomizer-csgo/actions/workflows/build_and_pre-release.yml/badge.svg?branch=stage)](https://github.com/Luziferium/randomizer-csgo/actions/workflows/build_and_pre-release.yml)

## About
A Randomizer to have more fun in CS:GO. This is NOT a cheat!

More specifically, this is an application that throws different selfmade eventcluster in an interval of set seconds (default 30-120).
Said eventclusters are a set of events which are simple button presses such as spacebar, left or right mouse button, w-a-s-d and other main buttons in csgo.

Since this is an application just sending random button presses and not interfere with the actual game, it's totally allowed and legal to use. You don't have to worry to face a ban when using it.

## Requirements

- Java 8 or higher
- This jar..

## Functionality
The first thing that catches your eye will be the Selection where you can select what to open.

If you click on "Randomizer" it will open the core of the application where the evencluster will be ran, once you start it. Also you can adjust the interval between the clusters in there.

If you click on "Builder" it will open the builder, where you can build, save and delete your eventclusters. You can simply drag and drop the events into the builder pane and adjust them to your liking. Some of the events also have "Interval-Settings", where you can adjust the interval between the key press&releases.
